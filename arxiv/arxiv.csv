http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13242v1,"Graph, as an important data representation, is ubiquitous in many real world applications ranging from social network analysis to biology. How to correctly and effectively learn and extract information from graph is essential for a large number of machine learning tasks. Graph embedding is a way to transform and encode the data structure in high dimensional and non-Euclidean feature space to a low dimensional and structural space, which is easily exploited by other machine learning algorithms. We have witnessed a huge surge of such embedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods such as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches usually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by building an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function directly. However, most of the existing GCN methods can only perform convolution operations with node features, while ignoring the handy information in edge features, such as relations in knowledge graphs. To address this problem, we present CensNet, Convolution with Edge-Node Switching graph neural network, for learning tasks in graph-structured data with both node and edge features. CensNet is a general graph embedding framework, which embeds both nodes and edges to a latent feature space. By using line graph of the original undirected graph, the role of nodes and edges are switched, and two novel graph convolution operations are proposed for feature propagation. Experimental results on real-world academic citation networks and quantum chemistry graphs show that our approach achieves or matches the state-of-the-art performance in four graph learning tasks, including semi-supervised node classification, multi-task graph classification, graph regression, and link prediction.",Co-embedding of Nodes and Edges with Graph Neural Networks,2020-10-25,"['Xiaodong Jiang', 'Ronghang Zhu', 'Sheng Li', 'Pengsheng Ji']"

However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular graph convolutions, a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph---atoms, bonds, distances, etc.---which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement.",Molecular Graph Convolutions: Moving Beyond Fingerprints,2016-03-02,"['Kevin McCloskey', 'Patrick Riley', 'Steven Kearnes', 'Marc Berndl', 'Vijay Pande']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13875v1,"In reliable decision-making systems based on machine learning, models have to be robust to distributional shifts or provide the uncertainty of their predictions. In node-level problems of graph learning, distributional shifts can be especially complex since the samples are interdependent. To evaluate the performance of graph models, it is important to test them on diverse and meaningful distributional shifts. However, most graph benchmarks that consider distributional shifts for node-level problems focus mainly on node features, while data in graph problems is primarily defined by its structural properties. In this work, we propose a general approach for inducing diverse distributional shifts based on graph structure. We use this approach to create data splits according to several structural node properties: popularity, locality, and density. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed distributional shifts and show that they are quite challenging for existing graph models. We hope that the proposed approach will be helpful for the further development of reliable graph machine learning.",Evaluating Robustness and Uncertainty of Graph Models Under Structural Distributional Shifts,2023-02-27,"['Gleb Bazhenov', 'Denis Kuznedelev', 'Liudmila Prokhorenkova', 'Artem Babenko', 'Andrey Malinin']"

To address these problems, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Contrastive Learning (RHCO) for large-scale heterogeneous graph representation learning. Unlike traditional heterogeneous graph neural networks, we adopt the contrastive learning mechanism to deal with the complex heterogeneity of large-scale heterogeneous graphs. We first learn relation-aware node embeddings under the network schema view. Then we propose a novel positive sample selection strategy to choose meaningful positive samples. After learning node embeddings under the positive sample graph view, we perform a cross-view contrastive learning to obtain the final node representations. Moreover, we adopt the label smoothing technique to boost the performance of RHCO. Extensive experiments on three large-scale academic heterogeneous graph datasets show that RHCO achieves best performance over the state-of-the-art models.",RHCO: A Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Contrastive Learning for Large-scale Graphs,2022-11-20,"['Xuehua Ming', 'Chenguang Du', 'Ting Jiang', 'Zhengyang Zhao', 'Fuzhen Zhuang', 'Ziming Wan', 'Deqing Wang']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12230v1,"Research on continual learning (CL) mainly focuses on data represented in the Euclidean space, while research on graph-structured data is scarce. Furthermore, most graph learning models are tailored for static graphs. However, graphs usually evolve continually in the real world. Catastrophic forgetting also emerges in graph learning models when being trained incrementally. This leads to the need to develop robust, effective and efficient continual graph learning approaches. Continual graph learning (CGL) is an emerging area aiming to realize continual learning on graph-structured data. This survey is written to shed light on this emerging area. It introduces the basic concepts of CGL and highlights two unique challenges brought by graphs. Then it reviews and categorizes recent state-of-the-art approaches, analyzing their strategies to tackle the unique challenges in CGL.

Although inductive approaches can generalize to unseen nodes, they neglect different contexts of nodes and cannot learn node embeddings dually. In this paper, we present a context-aware unsupervised dual encoding framework, \textbf{CADE}, to generate representations of nodes by combining real-time neighborhoods with neighbor-attentioned representation, and preserving extra memory of known nodes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02839v2,"Despite being very successful within the pattern recognition and machine learning community, graph-based methods are often unusable because of the lack of mathematical operations defined in graph domain. Graph embedding, which maps graphs to a vectorial space, has been proposed as a way to tackle these difficulties enabling the use of standard machine learning techniques. However, it is well known that graph embedding functions usually suffer from the loss of structural information. In this paper, we consider the hierarchical structure of a graph as a way to mitigate this loss of information. The hierarchical structure is constructed by topologically clustering the graph nodes, and considering each cluster as a node in the upper hierarchical level. Once this hierarchical structure is constructed, we consider several configurations to define the mapping into a vector space given a classical graph embedding, in particular, we propose to make use of the Stochastic Graphlet Embedding (SGE). Broadly speaking, SGE produces a distribution of uniformly sampled low to high order graphlets as a way to embed graphs into the vector space. In what follows, the coarse-to-fine structure of a graph hierarchy and the statistics fetched by the SGE complements each other and includes important structural information with varied contexts. Altogether, these two techniques substantially cope with the usual information loss involved in graph embedding techniques, obtaining a more robust graph representation. This fact has been corroborated through a detailed experimental evaluation on various benchmark graph datasets, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",Hierarchical stochastic graphlet embedding for graph-based pattern recognition,2018-07-08,"['Alicia Fornés', 'Pau Riba', 'Josep Lladós', 'Anjan Dutta']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02639v1,"Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently, whose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph. Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily depend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error, while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data simultaneously.

However, many existing methods focus on static graphs while ignoring evolving graph patterns. Inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks(GCNs) in static graph embedding, we propose a novel k-core based temporal graph convolutional network, the CTGCN, to learn node representations for dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous dynamic graph embedding methods, CTGCN can preserve both local connective proximity and global structural similarity while simultaneously capturing graph dynamics. In the proposed framework, the traditional graph convolution is generalized into two phases, feature transformation and feature aggregation, which gives the CTGCN more flexibility and enables the CTGCN to learn connective and structural information under the same framework. Experimental results on 7 real-world graphs demonstrate that the CTGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph embedding methods in several tasks, including link prediction and structural role classification.

By carefully analyzing existing graph databases, we identify 3 critical components important for advancing the field of graph representation learning: (1) large graphs, (2) many graphs, and (3) class diversity. To date, no single graph database offers all these desired properties. We introduce MalNet, the largest public graph database ever constructed, representing a large-scale ontology of malicious software function call graphs. MalNet contains over 1.2 million graphs, averaging over 15k nodes and 35k edges per graph, across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03508v3,"Graphs are complex objects that do not lend themselves easily to typical learning tasks. Recently, a range of approaches based on graph kernels or graph neural networks have been developed for graph classification and for representation learning on graphs in general. As the developed methodologies become more sophisticated, it is important to understand which components of the increasingly complex methods are necessary or most effective. As a first step, we develop a simple yet meaningful graph representation, and explore its effectiveness in graph classification. We test our baseline representation for the graph classification task on a range of graph datasets. Interestingly, this simple representation achieves similar performance as the state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph neural networks for non-attributed graph classification. Its performance on classifying attributed graphs is slightly weaker as it does not incorporate attributes. However, given its simplicity and efficiency, we believe that it still serves as an effective baseline for attributed graph classification. Our graph representation is efficient (linear-time) to compute. We also provide a simple connection with the graph neural networks. Note that these observations are only for the task of graph classification while existing methods are often designed for a broader scope including node embedding and link prediction. The results are also likely biased due to the limited amount of benchmark datasets available. Nevertheless, the good performance of our simple baseline calls for the development of new, more comprehensive benchmark datasets so as to better evaluate and analyze different graph learning methods. Furthermore, given the computational efficiency of our graph summary, we believe that it is a good candidate as a baseline method for future graph classification (or even other graph learning) studies.",A simple yet effective baseline for non-attributed graph classification,2018-11-08,"['Chen Cai', 'Yusu Wang']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10908v1,"Graph neural networks get significant attention for graph representation and classification in machine learning community. Attention mechanism applied on the neighborhood of a node improves the performance of graph neural networks. Typically, it helps to identify a neighbor node which plays more important role to determine the label of the node under consideration. But in real world scenarios, a particular subset of nodes together, but not the individual pairs in the subset, may be important to determine the label of the graph. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of subgraph attention for graphs. On the other hand, hierarchical graph pooling has been shown to be promising in recent literature. But due to noisy hierarchical structure of real world graphs, not all the hierarchies of a graph play equal role for graph classification. Towards this end, we propose a graph classification algorithm called SubGattPool which jointly learns the subgraph attention and employs two different types of hierarchical attention mechanisms to find the important nodes in a hierarchy and the importance of individual hierarchies in a graph. Experimental evaluation with different types of graph classification algorithms shows that SubGattPool is able to improve the state-of-the-art or remains competitive on multiple publicly available graph classification datasets. We conduct further experiments on both synthetic and real world graph datasets to justify the usefulness of different components of SubGattPool and to show its consistent performance on other downstream tasks.",Robust Hierarchical Graph Classification with Subgraph Attention,2020-07-19,"['Manasvi Aggarwal', 'M.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01090v2,"This paper proposes a new Quantum Spatial Graph Convolutional Neural Network (QSGCNN) model that can directly learn a classification function for graphs of arbitrary sizes. Unlike state-of-the-art Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) models, the proposed QSGCNN model incorporates the process of identifying transitive aligned vertices between graphs, and transforms arbitrary sized graphs into fixed-sized aligned vertex grid structures. In order to learn representative graph characteristics, a new quantum spatial graph convolution is proposed and employed to extract multi-scale vertex features, in terms of quantum information propagation between grid vertices of each graph. Since the quantum spatial convolution preserves the grid structures of the input vertices (i.e., the convolution layer does not change the original spatial sequence of vertices), the proposed QSGCNN model allows to directly employ the traditional convolutional neural network architecture to further learn from the global graph topology, providing an end-to-end deep learning architecture that integrates the graph representation and learning in the quantum spatial graph convolution layer and the traditional convolutional layer for graph classifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QSGCNN model in relation to existing state-of-the-art methods.

By observing a dataset of graph signals, and considering specific assumptions, Graph Signal Processing (GSP) tools can provide practical constraints in the GL approach. One applicable constraint can infer a graph with desired frequency signatures, i.e., spectral templates. However, a severe computational burden is a challenging barrier, especially for inference from high-dimensional graph signals. To address this issue and in the case of the underlying graph having graph product structure, we propose learning product (high dimensional) graphs from product spectral templates with significantly reduced complexity rather than learning them directly from high-dimensional graph signals, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed in the related areas.

However, in this paper, we observe that this assumption does not always hold, for example, any perturbation to nodes or edges in a molecular graph will change the graph labels to some degree.

In such cases, distributed processing appears as a natural solution, where the data stays mostly local and all processing is performed among neighbours nodes on the communication graph. We propose here a novel distributed graph learning algorithm, which permits to infer a graph from signal observations on the nodes under the assumption that the data is smooth on the target graph. We solve a distributed optimization problem with local projection constraints to infer a valid graph while limiting the communication costs.

Conventional embedding methods that consider high-order topology proximities can then be easily applied to the newly constructed graph to learn the representations of both node and attribute while capturing the nonlinear high-order intrinsic correlation inside or among graph structure and semantic. The learned attribute embeddings can also effectively support some semantic-oriented inference tasks (e.g., semantic community detection), helping to reveal the graph's deep semantic.

While traditional approaches are largely transductive, recent graph neural networks (GNNs) integrate node features with network structures, thus enabling inductive node classification models that can be applied to new nodes or even new graphs in the same feature space. However, inter-graph differences still exist across graphs within the same domain. Thus, training just one global model (e.g., a state-of-the-art GNN) to handle all new graphs, whilst ignoring the inter-graph differences, can lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we study the problem of inductive node classification across graphs. Unlike existing one-model-fits-all approaches, we propose a novel meta-inductive framework called MI-GNN to customize the inductive model to each graph under a meta-learning paradigm. That is, MI-GNN does not directly learn an inductive model; it learns the general knowledge of how to train a model for semi-supervised node classification on new graphs. To cope with the differences across graphs, MI-GNN employs a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and task levels. More specifically, we learn a graph prior to adapt for the graph-level differences, and a task prior to adapt for the task-level differences conditioned on a graph.

We concentrate on two important primitives: embedding graphs or their nodes into a continuous vector space representation (encoding) and, conversely, generating graphs from such vectors back (decoding). To that end, we make the following contributions. First, we introduce Edge-Conditioned Convolutions (ECC), a convolution-like operation on graphs performed in the spatial domain where filters are dynamically generated based on edge attributes. The method is used to encode graphs with arbitrary and varying structure. Second, we propose SuperPoint Graph, an intermediate point cloud representation with rich edge attributes encoding the contextual relationship between object parts. Based on this representation, ECC is employed to segment large-scale point clouds without major sacrifice in fine details. Third, we present GraphVAE, a graph generator allowing us to decode graphs with variable but upper-bounded number of nodes making use of approximate graph matching for aligning the predictions of an autoencoder with its inputs. The method is applied to the task of molecule generation.",Deep Learning on Attributed Graphs: A Journey from Graphs to Their Embeddings and Back,2019-01-24,['Martin Simonovsky']

The use of graph data in SGC implicitly assumes the common but not universal graph characteristic of homophily, wherein nodes link to nodes which are similar. Here we confirm that SGC is indeed ineffective for heterophilous (i.e., non-homophilous) graphs via experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. We propose Adaptive Simple Graph Convolution (ASGC), which we show can adapt to both homophilous and heterophilous graph structure. Like SGC, ASGC is not a deep model, and hence is fast, scalable, and interpretable; further, we can prove performance guarantees on natural synthetic data models. Empirically, ASGC is often competitive with recent deep models at node classification on a benchmark of real-world datasets. The SGC paper questioned whether the complexity of graph neural networks is warranted for common graph problems involving homophilous networks; our results similarly suggest that, while deep learning often achieves the highest performance, heterophilous structure alone does not necessitate these more involved methods.",Simplified Graph Convolution with Heterophily,2022-02-08,"['Cameron Musco', 'Sudhanshu Chanpuriya']"

The dictionary is constructed on polynomials of the graph Laplacian, which can sparsely represent a general class of graph signals composed of localized patterns on the graph. We formulate a graph learning problem, whose solution provides an ideal fit between the signal observations and the sparse graph signal model.

We classify them into four categories based on their model architectures, namely graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph autoencoder (GAE), and other graph learning models. The differences between these methods are also compared in a systematic manner. Furthermore, we outline several graph-based anomaly analytics applications across various domains in the real world. Finally, we discuss five potential future research directions in this rapidly growing field.","Graph Learning for Anomaly Analytics: Algorithms, Applications, and Challenges",2022-12-11,"['Charu C.

However, incomplete graph data and missing node attributes can have a negative impact on media knowledge discovery. Existing methods for handling attribute missing graph have limited assumptions or fail to capture complex attribute-graph dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Attribute missing Graph Contrastive Learning (AmGCL), a framework for handling missing node attributes in attribute graph data. AmGCL leverages Dirichlet energy minimization-based feature precoding to encode in missing attributes and a self-supervised Graph Augmentation Contrastive Learning Structure (GACLS) to learn latent variables from the encoded-in data. Specifically, AmGCL utilizies feature reconstruction based on structure-attribute energy minimization while maximizes the lower bound of evidence for latent representation mutual information. Our experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that AmGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both feature imputation and node classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method in real-world attribute graph analysis tasks.",AmGCL: Feature Imputation of Attribute Missing Graph via Self-supervised Contrastive Learning,2023-05-05,"['Xiaochuan Zhang', 'Haojun Fei', 'Ye Wang', 'Mengran Li']"

In the representation learning phase, GDPNet aggregates features from signal neighbors to generate node representations for down-stream tasks, and provides task-specific rewards to the signal neighbor selection phase. These two phases are jointly trained to select optimal sets of neighbors for target nodes with maximum cumulative task-specific rewards, and to learn robust representations for nodes.

Meta-paths consist of these types and abstract paths in the graph. Until now, meta-paths can only be used as categorical features with high redundancy and are therefore unsuitable for machine learning models. We propose meta-path embeddings to solve this problem by learning semantical and compact vector representations of them.

Comparing with other data structures, such as sequences and trees, graphs are generally more powerful in representing complex correlations among entities. For example, a knowledge graph stores real-word entities (such as Barack_Obama and U.S.) and their relations (such as live_in and lead_by). Properly encoding a knowledge graph is beneficial to user applications, such as question answering and knowledge discovery. Modeling graphs is also very challenging, probably because graphs usually contain massive and cyclic relations. Recent years have witnessed the success of deep learning, especially RNN-based models, on many NLP problems. Besides, RNNs and their variations have been extensively studied on several graph problems and showed preliminary successes. Despite the successes that have been achieved, RNN-based models suffer from several major drawbacks on graphs. First, they can only consume sequential data, thus linearization is required to serialize input graphs, resulting in the loss of important structural information. Second, the serialization results are usually very long, so it takes a long time for RNNs to encode them. In this thesis, we propose a novel graph neural network, named graph recurrent network (GRN). We study our GRN model on 4 very different tasks, such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction and machine translation. Some take undirected graphs without edge labels, while the others have directed ones with edge labels.

Our method, named interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weight of each subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can provide insight into the given classification task. Because our formulation has a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm that uses pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set selection methods is also proposed. An important property of IGML is that solution optimality is guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem and our pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Furthermore, we show that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as itemset and sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a transportation-based subgraph feature.

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically, AutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an auto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a probability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph view generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the original graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation learns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole contrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training strategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the classifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet semantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive experiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the state-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization results further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more compact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the existing view generation methods.",AutoGCL: Automated Graph Contrastive Learning via Learnable View Generators,2021-09-21,"['Qingzhong Wang', 'Siyu Huang', 'Haoyi Xiong', 'Yihang Yin', 'Xiang Zhang']"

Due to the high acquisition cost and processing time of multimodal MRI, existing deep learning frameworks based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) focused on predicting the missing multimodal medical images from a few existing modalities. While brain graphs help better understand how a particular disorder can change the connectional facets of the brain, synthesizing a target brain multigraph (i.e, multiple brain graphs) from a single source brain graph is strikingly lacking. Additionally, existing graph generation works mainly learn one model for each target domain which limits their scalability in jointly predicting multiple target domains. Besides, while they consider the global topological scale of a graph (i.e., graph connectivity structure), they overlook the local topology at the node scale (e.g., how central a node is in the graph). To address these limitations, we introduce topology-aware graph GAN architecture (topoGAN), which jointly predicts multiple brain graphs from a single brain graph while preserving the topological structure of each target graph. Its three key innovations are: (i) designing a novel graph adversarial auto-encoder for predicting multiple brain graphs from a single one, (ii) clustering the encoded source graphs in order to handle the mode collapse issue of GAN and proposing a cluster-specific decoder, (iii) introducing a topological loss to force the prediction of topologically sound target brain graphs.

It is thus important to transfer ConvNets between graphs.

We show that if two graphs discretize the same continuous space, then a spectral filter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs.

Most existing GCNs are limited to deal with documents included in a pre-defined graph, i.e., it cannot be generalized to out-of-graph documents. To address this issue, we propose to transform the document graph into a word graph, to decouple data samples (i.e., documents in training and test sets) and a GCN model by using a document-independent graph. Such word-level GCN could therefore naturally inference out-of-graph documents in an inductive way. The proposed Word-level Graph (WGraph) can not only implicitly learning word presentation with commonly-used word co-occurrences in corpora, but also incorporate extra global semantic dependency derived from inter-document relationships (e.g., literature citations).

However, such clustering would discard some graph information and achieve the suboptimal results. It is because the node inherently has different characteristics or roles, and two non-isomorphic graphs may have the same coarse-grained structure that cannot be distinguished after pooling. To compensate the loss caused by coarse-grained clustering and further advance GNN, we propose a multi-channel graph convolutional networks (MuchGCN).

These approaches have two disadvantages in the graph classification task: (1)when only the largest sub-graph structure ($k$-hop neighbor) is used for neighborhood aggregation, a large amount of early-stage information is lost during the graph convolution step; (2) simple average/sum pooling or max pooling utilized, which loses the characteristics of each node and the topology between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called, dual attention graph convolutional networks (DAGCN) to address these problems. DAGCN automatically learns the importance of neighbors at different hops using a novel attention graph convolution layer, and then employs a second attention component, a self-attention pooling layer, to generalize the graph representation from the various aspects of a matrix graph embedding. The dual attention network is trained in an end-to-end manner for the graph classification task. We compare our model with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other deep learning methods. The experimental results show that our framework not only outperforms other baselines but also achieves a better rate of convergence.",DAGCN: Dual Attention Graph Convolutional Networks,2019-04-04,"['Shirui Pan', 'Guodong Long', 'Fengwen Chen', 'Huan Huo', 'Jing Jiang']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13107v2,"Graph neural networks, which generalize deep neural network models to graph structured data, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. They usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating and aggregating node features and have been proven to improve the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and link prediction. To apply graph neural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate the \textit{graph representation} from node representations are demanded. A common way is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural information is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to preserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning. There are some recent works on hierarchically learning graph representation analogous to the pooling step in conventional convolutional neural (CNN) networks. However, the local structural information is still largely neglected during the pooling process. In this paper, we introduce a pooling operator $\pooling$ based on graph Fourier transform, which can utilize the node features and local structures during the pooling process. We then design pooling layers based on the pooling operator, which are further combined with traditional GCN convolutional layers to form a graph neural network framework $\m$ for graph classification. Theoretical analysis is provided to understand $\pooling$ from both local and global perspectives.

Graph CNNs are attracting increasing attention due to their effectiveness and efficiency. However, the existing convolution approaches focus only on regular data forms and require the transfer of the graph or key node neighborhoods of the graph into the same fixed form. During this transfer process, structural information of the graph can be lost, and some redundant information can be incorporated. To overcome this problem, we propose the disordered graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) based on the mixed Gaussian model, which extends the CNN by adding a preprocessing layer called the disordered graph convolutional layer (DGCL). The DGCL uses a mixed Gaussian function to realize the mapping between the convolution kernel and the nodes in the neighborhood of the graph. The output of the DGCL is the input of the CNN. We further implement a backward-propagation optimization process of the convolutional layer by which we incorporate the feature-learning model of the irregular node neighborhood structure into the network. Thereafter, the optimization of the convolution kernel becomes part of the neural network learning process. The DGCNN can accept arbitrary scaled and disordered neighborhood graph structures as the receptive fields of CNNs, which reduces information loss during graph transformation. Finally, we perform experiments on multiple standard graph datasets.

Graph neural networks have been demonstrated power in graph representation learning while their performance is affected by the completeness of graph information.

In this paper, we propose an innovative node representation learning framework, Wasserstein Graph Neural Network (WGNN), to mitigate the problem. To make the most of limited observed attribute information and capture the uncertainty caused by missing values, we express nodes as low-dimensional distributions derived from the decomposition of the attribute matrix. Furthermore, we strengthen the expressiveness of representations by developing a novel message passing schema that aggregates distributional information from neighbors in the Wasserstein space. We test WGNN in node classification tasks under two missing-attribute cases on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In addition, we find WGNN suitable to recover missing values and adapt them to tackle matrix completion problems with graphs of users and items.

Specifically, we exploit two attention forms compatible with a self-supervised task to predict edges, whose presence and absence contain the inherent information about the importance of the relationships between nodes. By encoding edges, SuperGAT learns more expressive attention in distinguishing mislinked neighbors. We find two graph characteristics influence the effectiveness of attention forms and self-supervision: homophily and average degree.

However, there has been relatively less work on analyzing their ability to generate structured outputs such as graphs. Unlike natural language, graphs have distinct structural and semantic properties in the context of a downstream NLP task, e.g., generating a graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we study pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and semantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision, pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since curating large amount of human-annotated graphs is expensive and tedious, we propose simple yet effective ways of graph perturbations via node and edge edit operations that lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin and InfoNCE losses. Our methods lead to significant improvements in both structural and semantic accuracy of explanation graphs and also generalize to other similar graph generation tasks. Lastly, we show that human errors are the best negatives for contrastive learning and also that automatically generating more such human-like negative graphs can lead to further improvements.

Learning a useful feature representation from graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks such as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others. Many existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or estimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task. Examples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as well as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk used by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This has three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently transductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second, they are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which is impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support for attributed graphs. To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework for inductive network representation learning based on the notion of attributed random walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning a function $\Phi : \mathrm{\rm \bf x} \rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute vector $\mathrm{\rm \bf x}$ to a type $w$.

They are useful for a wide range of graph analysis tasks including link prediction, node classification, recommendation and visualization. Most existing approaches represent graph nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional embedding space, ignoring the uncertainty present in the real-world graphs.

Although promising, existing works mainly focus on superresolving graphs belonging to the same domain (e.g., functional), overlooking the domain fracture existing between multimodal brain data distributions (e.g., morphological and structural). To this aim, we propose a novel inter-domain adaptation framework namely, Learn to SuperResolve Brain Graphs with Knowledge Distillation Network (L2S-KDnet), which adopts a teacher-student paradigm to superresolve brain graphs. Our teacher network is a graph encoder-decoder that firstly learns the LR brain graph embeddings, and secondly learns how to align the resulting latent representations to the HR ground truth data distribution using an adversarial regularization. Ultimately, it decodes the HR graphs from the aligned embeddings. Next, our student network learns the knowledge of the aligned brain graphs as well as the topological structure of the predicted HR graphs transferred from the teacher.

However, the current network may allocate the same color to the nodes connected by an edge resulting in an invalid coloring of the interference graph. Since it is difficult to encode constraints in an LSTM to avoid invalid coloring, we augment our deep learning network with a color correction phase that runs after the colors have been allocated by the network.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced three-stage method via lifting, named LiftPool, to improve hierarchical graph representation by maximally preserving the local structural information in graph pooling. LiftPool introduces an additional stage of graph lifting before graph coarsening to preserve the local information of the removed nodes and decouple the processes of node removing and feature reduction. Specifically, for each node to be removed, its local information is obtained by subtracting the global information aggregated from its neighboring preserved nodes. Subsequently, this local information is aligned and propagated to the preserved nodes to alleviate information loss in graph coarsening. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed LiftPool is localized and permutation-invariant.

Existing methods were designed to learn the association between observed graph structure and existence of link between a pair of nodes. However, the causal relationship between the two variables was largely ignored for learning to predict links on a graph. In this work, we visit this factor by asking a counterfactual question: would the link still exist if the graph structure became different from observation? Its answer, counterfactual links, will be able to augment the graph data for representation learning. To create these links, we employ causal models that consider the information (i.e., learned representations) of node pairs as context, global graph structural properties as treatment, and link existence as outcome. We propose a novel data augmentation-based link prediction method that creates counterfactual links and learns representations from both the observed and counterfactual links.

However, evaluating whether the graph contrastive learning is robust to adversarial attacks is still an open problem because most existing graph adversarial attacks are supervised models, which means they heavily rely on labels and can only be used to evaluate the graph contrastive learning in a specific scenario. For unsupervised graph representation methods such as graph contrastive learning, it is difficult to acquire labels in real-world scenarios, making traditional supervised graph attack methods difficult to be applied to test their robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised gradient-based adversarial attack that does not rely on labels for graph contrastive learning. We compute the gradients of the adjacency matrices of the two views and flip the edges with gradient ascent to maximize the contrastive loss. In this way, we can fully use multiple views generated by the graph contrastive learning models and pick the most informative edges without knowing their labels, and therefore can promisingly support our model adapted to more kinds of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our attack outperforms unsupervised baseline attacks and has comparable performance with supervised attacks in multiple downstream tasks including node classification and link prediction.

Despite the proliferation of various graph augmentation strategies, some fundamental questions still remain unclear: what information is essentially encoded into the learned representations by GCL? Are there some general graph augmentation rules behind different augmentations? If so, what are they and what insights can they bring? In this paper, we answer these questions by establishing the connection between GCL and graph spectrum. By an experimental investigation in spectral domain, we firstly find the General grAph augMEntation (GAME) rule for GCL, i.e., the difference of the high-frequency parts between two augmented graphs should be larger than that of low-frequency parts. This rule reveals the fundamental principle to revisit the current graph augmentations and design new effective graph augmentations. Then we theoretically prove that GCL is able to learn the invariance information by contrastive invariance theorem, together with our GAME rule, for the first time, we uncover that the learned representations by GCL essentially encode the low-frequency information, which explains why GCL works. Guided by this rule, we propose a spectral graph contrastive learning module (SpCo), which is a general and GCL-friendly plug-in.

At the same time, such training data are often unavailable for applications of interest, such as automatic target recognition (ATR) and SAR data. We use a Convolutional Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (CNNVAE) to embed SAR data into a feature space, and then construct a similarity graph from the embedded data and apply graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques. The CNNVAE feature embedding and graph construction requires no labeled data, which reduces overfitting and improves the generalization performance of graph learning at low label rates. Furthermore, the method easily incorporates a human-in-the-loop for active learning in the data-labeling process. We present promising results and compare them to other standard machine learning methods on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset for ATR with small amounts of labeled data.",Graph-based Active Learning for Semi-supervised Classification of SAR Data,2022-03-31,"['Kevin Miller', 'John Mauro', 'Zhan Shi', 'Jason Setiadi', 'Andrea L.

By manually constructing positive/negative samples, most graph contrastive learning methods rely on the vector inner product based similarity metric to distinguish the samples for graph representation. However, the handcrafted sample construction (e.g., the perturbation on the nodes or edges of the graph) may not effectively capture the intrinsic local structures of the graph. Also, the vector inner product based similarity metric cannot fully exploit the local structures of the graph to characterize the graph difference well.

We focus on graph-based techniques, where the unlabeled examples are connected in a graph under the implicit assumption that similar nodes likely have similar labels. Over the past decades, several elegant graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms for how to infer the labels of the unlabeled examples given the graph and a few labeled examples have been proposed. However, the problem of how to create the graph (which impacts the practical usefulness of these methods significantly) has been relegated to domain-specific art and heuristics and no general principles have been proposed. In this work we present a novel data driven approach for learning the graph and provide strong formal guarantees in both the distributional and online learning formalizations.

A class of GNNs solves this problem by learning implicit weights to represent the importance of neighbor nodes, which we call implicit GNNs such as Graph Attention Network. The basic idea of implicit GNNs is to introduce graph information with special properties followed by Learnable Transformation Structures (LTS) which encode the importance of neighbor nodes via a data-driven way. In this paper, we argue that LTS makes the special properties of graph information disappear during the learning process, resulting in graph information unhelpful for learning node representations. We call this phenomenon Graph Information Vanishing (GIV). Also, we find that LTS maps different graph information into highly similar results. To validate the above two points, we design two sets of 70 random experiments on five Implicit GNNs methods and seven benchmark datasets by using a random permutation operator to randomly disrupt the order of graph information and replacing graph information with random values. We find that randomization does not affect the model performance in 93\% of the cases, with about 7 percentage causing an average 0.5\% accuracy loss. And the cosine similarity of output results, generated by LTS mapping different graph information, over 99\% with an 81\% proportion. The experimental results provide evidence to support the existence of GIV in Implicit GNNs and imply that the existing methods of Implicit GNNs do not make good use of graph information.

Such graphs play a key role for many downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, graph learning, and nearest neighbor search. For these tasks, it is critical to build graphs which are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we present $\textit{Stars}$: a highly scalable method for building extremely sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck for learning based models where comparisons are expensive to evaluate. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time, where approximate nearest neighbors are contained within two-hop neighborhoods. In practice, we have deployed Stars for multiple data sets allowing for graph building at the $\textit{Tera-Scale}$, i.e., for graphs with tens of trillions of edges.

It can be formulated by optimizing Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) with a mutual information estimator. However, GIB suffers from training instability and degenerated results due to its intrinsic optimization process. To tackle these issues, we reformulate the subgraph recognition problem into two steps: graph perturbation and subgraph selection, leading to a novel Variational Graph Information Bottleneck (VGIB) framework. VGIB first employs the noise injection to modulate the information flow from the input graph to the perturbed graph. Then, the perturbed graph is encouraged to be informative to the graph property. VGIB further obtains the desired subgraph by filtering out the noise in the perturbed graph. With the customized noise prior for each input, the VGIB objective is endowed with a tractable variational upper bound, leading to a superior empirical performance as well as theoretical properties. Extensive experiments on graph interpretation, explainability of Graph Neural Networks, and graph classification show that VGIB finds better subgraphs than existing methods.

GNNs are usually stacked to multiple layers and the node representations in each layer are computed through propagating and aggregating the neighboring node features with respect to the graph. By stacking to multiple layers, GNNs are able to capture the long-range dependencies among the data on the graph and thus bring performance improvements. To train a GNN with multiple layers effectively, some normalization techniques (e.g., node-wise normalization, batch-wise normalization) are necessary. However, the normalization techniques for GNNs are highly task-relevant and different application tasks prefer to different normalization techniques, which is hard to know in advance. To tackle this deficiency, in this paper, we propose to learn graph normalization by optimizing a weighted combination of normalization techniques at four different levels, including node-wise normalization, adjacency-wise normalization, graph-wise normalization, and batch-wise normalization, in which the adjacency-wise normalization and the graph-wise normalization are newly proposed in this paper to take into account the local structure and the global structure on the graph, respectively.

This paper focuses on purely machine learned and purely knowledge-based BNs and investigates their differences in terms of graphical structure and how well the implied statistical models explain the data. The tests are based on four previous case studies whose BN structure was determined by domain knowledge. Using various metrics, we compare the knowledge-based graphs to the machine learned graphs generated from various algorithms implemented in TETRAD spanning all three classes of learning. The results show that, while the algorithms produce graphs with much higher model selection score, the knowledge-based graphs are more accurate predictors of variables of interest. Maximising score fitting is ineffective in the presence of limited sample size because the fitting becomes increasingly distorted with limited data, guiding algorithms towards graphical patterns that share higher fitting scores and yet deviate considerably from the true graph. This highlights the value of causal knowledge in these cases, as well as the need for more appropriate fitting scores suitable for limited data.

Nevertheless, unlike images, it is much more difficult to design reasonable augmentations without changing the nature of graphs. Although exciting, the current graph contrastive learning does not achieve as promising performance as visual contrastive learning. We conjecture the current performance of graph contrastive learning might be limited by the violation of the label-invariant augmentation assumption. In light of this, we propose a label-invariant augmentation for graph-structured data to address this challenge. Different from the node/edge modification and subgraph extraction, we conduct the augmentation in the representation space and generate the augmented samples in the most difficult direction while keeping the label of augmented data the same as the original samples. In the semi-supervised scenario, we demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the classical graph neural network based methods and recent graph contrastive learning on eight benchmark graph-structured data, followed by several in-depth experiments to further explore the label-invariant augmentation in several aspects.",Label-invariant Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Graph Classification,2022-05-19,"['Chuxu Zhang', 'Chunhui Zhang', 'Hongfu Liu', 'Han Yue']"

We use graph limits called graphons to define limit objects for graph filters and GNNs -- graphon filters and graphon neural networks (WNNs) -- which we interpret as generative models for graph filters and GNNs. We then show that graphon filters and WNNs can be approximated by graph filters and GNNs sampled from them on weighted and stochastic graphs. Because the error of these approximations can be upper bounded, by a triangle inequality argument we can further bound the error of transferring a graph filter or a GNN across graphs. Our results show that (i) the transference error decreases with the graph size, and (ii) that graph filters have a transferability-discriminability tradeoff that in GNNs is alleviated by the scattering behavior of the nonlinearity.

Moreover, to enhance the generalization ability of GNNs, it has become common practice to further increase the diversity of training graph structures by incorporating graph augmentations and/or performing large-scale pre-training on more graphs. Therefore, it becomes essential for a GNN to simultaneously model diverse graph structures. Yet, naively increasing the GNN model capacity will suffer from both higher inference costs and the notorious trainability issue of GNNs. This paper introduces the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) idea to GNNs, aiming to enhance their ability to accommodate the diversity of training graph structures, without incurring computational overheads.

To properly represent molecules, graph contrastive learning is a promising paradigm as it utilizes self-supervision signals and has no requirements for human annotations. However, prior works fail to incorporate fundamental domain knowledge into graph semantics and thus ignore the correlations between atoms that have common attributes but are not directly connected by bonds. To address these issues, we construct a Chemical Element Knowledge Graph (KG) to summarize microscopic associations between elements and propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Contrastive Learning (KCL) framework for molecular representation learning. KCL framework consists of three modules. The first module, knowledge-guided graph augmentation, augments the original molecular graph based on the Chemical Element KG. The second module, knowledge-aware graph representation, extracts molecular representations with a common graph encoder for the original molecular graph and a Knowledge-aware Message Passing Neural Network (KMPNN) to encode complex information in the augmented molecular graph.

Inspired by the bio-fidelity and energy-efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs), recent methods attempt to adapt GNNs to the SNN framework by substituting spiking neurons for the activation functions. However, existing SNN-based GNN methods cannot be applied to the more general multi-node representation learning problem represented by link prediction. Moreover, these methods did not fully exploit the bio-fidelity of SNNs, as they still require costly multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which severely harm the energy efficiency. To address the above issues and improve energy efficiency, in this paper, we propose an SNN-based deep generative method, namely the Spiking Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (S-VGAE) for efficient graph representation learning. To deal with the multi-node problem, we propose a probabilistic decoder that generates binary latent variables as spiking node representations and reconstructs graphs via the weighted inner product. To avoid the MAC operations for energy efficiency, we further decouple the propagation and transformation layers of conventional GNN aggregators.

With this interpretation, classical signal processing tools such as frequency analysis have been successfully applied with analogous interpretation to graph data, generating new insights for data science. What follows is a user guide on a specific class of graph data, where the generating graph filters are low-pass, i.e., the filter attenuates contents in the higher graph frequencies while retaining contents in the lower frequencies. Our choice is motivated by the prevalence of low-pass models in application domains such as social networks, financial markets, and power systems. We illustrate how to leverage properties of low-pass graph filters to learn the graph topology or identify its community structure; efficiently represent graph data through sampling, recover missing measurements, and de-noise graph data; the low-pass property is also used as the baseline to detect anomalies.",A User Guide to Low-Pass Graph Signal Processing and its Applications,2020-08-04,"['Anna Scaglione', 'Raksha Ramakrishna', 'Hoi-To Wai']"

In experiments on large real-world graphs, we show that graphs generated from the HRG approach exhibit a diverse range of properties that are similar to those found in the original networks. In addition to graph properties like degree or eigenvector centrality, what a graph looks like ultimately depends on small details in local graph substructures that are difficult to define at a global level.

We argue that recommendation on global and local graphs outperforms that on a single global graph or multiple local graphs.

An important challenge is thus to design accurate graph modeling approaches while guaranteeing fairness according to the specific notion of fairness that the problem requires. Yet, past work on the topic remains scarce, is limited to debiasing specific graph modeling methods, and often aims to ensure fairness in an indirect manner. We propose a generic approach applicable to most probabilistic graph modeling approaches. Specifically, we first define the class of fair graph models corresponding to a chosen set of fairness criteria. Given this, we propose a fairness regularizer defined as the KL-divergence between the graph model and its I-projection onto the set of fair models. We demonstrate that using this fairness regularizer in combination with existing graph modeling approaches efficiently trades-off fairness with accuracy, whereas the state-of-the-art models can only make this trade-off for the fairness criterion that they were specifically designed for.",The KL-Divergence between a Graph Model and its Fair I-Projection as a Fairness Regularizer,2021-03-02,"['Tijl De Bie', 'Maarten Buyl']"

In the large graph limit, GNNs are known to converge to certain continuous models known as c-GNNs, which directly enables a study of their approximation power on random graph models. In the absence of input node features however, just as GNNs are limited by the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test, c-GNNs will be severely limited on simple random graph models. For instance, they will fail to distinguish the communities of a well-separated Stochastic Block Model (SBM) with constant degree function. Thus, we consider recently proposed architectures that augment GNNs with unique node identifiers, referred to as Structural GNNs here (SGNNs). We study the convergence of SGNNs to their continuous counterpart (c-SGNNs) in the large random graph limit, under new conditions on the node identifiers.

An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy.

Various existing techniques either rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to preserve topological properties within the samples or are prohibitively expensive for larger graphs.

Sampling of a random graph is carried out by replacing each node's neighbors by those of a randomly sampled similar node. The sampled graphs preserve key characteristics of the graph structure without explicitly targeting them. Additionally, sampling from this model is extremely simple and scales linearly with the nodes. We show the usefulness of the copying model in three tasks. First, in node classification, a Bayesian formulation based on node copying achieves higher accuracy in sparse data settings.

The main challenge is how to optimize the fine-grained fusion weights while generating the learned graph that fits the clustering task, thus making the clustering representation meaningful and competitive.

Here we present a model-agnostic framework for interpreting important graph structure and node features, Graph neural networks Including SparSe inTerpretability (GISST). With any GNN model, GISST combines an attention mechanism and sparsity regularization to yield an important subgraph and node feature subset related to any graph-based task. Through a single self-attention layer, a GISST model learns an importance probability for each node feature and edge in the input graph. By including these importance probabilities in the model loss function, the probabilities are optimized end-to-end and tied to the task-specific performance. Furthermore, GISST sparsifies these importance probabilities with entropy and L1 regularization to reduce noise in the input graph topology and node features. Our GISST models achieve superior node feature and edge explanation precision in synthetic datasets, as compared to alternative interpretation approaches. Moreover, our GISST models are able to identify important graph structure in real-world datasets.

In many graph signal processing settings, it is important to transfer a filter from one graph to another. One example is in graph convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), where the dataset consists of signals defined on many different graphs, and the learned filters should generalize to signals on new graphs, not present in the training set. A necessary condition for transferability (the ability to transfer filters) is stability. Namely, given a graph filter, if we add a small perturbation to the graph, then the filter on the perturbed graph is a small perturbation of the original filter. It is a common misconception that spectral filters are not stable, and this paper aims at debunking this mistake. We introduce a space of filters, called the Cayley smoothness space, that contains the filters of state-of-the-art spectral filtering methods, and whose filters can approximate any generic spectral filter. For filters in this space, the perturbation in the filter is bounded by a constant times the perturbation in the graph, and filters in the Cayley smoothness space are thus termed linearly stable.

Classical methods usually boil down to a backtracking framework that needs to navigate a huge search space with prohibitive computational costs. Some recent studies resort to graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a low-dimensional representation for both the query and input graphs, in order to predict the number of subgraph isomorphisms on the input graph. However, typical GNNs employ a node-centric message passing scheme that receives and aggregates messages on nodes, which is inadequate in complex structure matching for isomorphism counting. Moreover, on an input graph, the space of possible query graphs is enormous, and different parts of the input graph will be triggered to match different queries. Thus, expecting a fixed representation of the input graph to match diversely structured query graphs is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN called Count-GNN for subgraph isomorphism counting, to deal with the above challenges. At the edge level, given that an edge is an atomic unit of encoding graph structures, we propose an edge-centric message passing scheme, where messages on edges are propagated and aggregated based on the edge adjacency to preserve fine-grained structural information. At the graph level, we modulate the input graph representation conditioned on the query, so that the input graph can be adapted to each query individually to improve their matching. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superior performance of Count-GNN.",Learning to Count Isomorphisms with Graph Neural Networks,2023-02-07,"['Xinming Zhang', 'Xingtong Yu', 'Yuan Fang', 'Zemin Liu']"

To capture dynamic dependencies among variables, we propose dynamic graphs learning method to generate time-varying matrices based on changing node features and static node embeddings. And in the method, we integrate the learned static graph information as inductive bias to construct dynamic graphs and local spatio-temporal patterns better.

For disease prediction tasks, most existing graph-based methods tend to define the graph manually based on specified modality (e.g., demographic information), and then integrated other modalities to obtain the patient representation by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, constructing an appropriate graph in advance is not a simple matter for these methods. Meanwhile, the complex correlation between modalities is ignored. These factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing sufficient information about the patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Multi-modal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction with multi-modality. To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with the disease, modality-aware representation learning is proposed to aggregate the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the graph manually, the latent graph structure is captured through an effective way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Our model is also applicable to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group of experiments on two disease prediction tasks demonstrates that the proposed MMGL achieves more favorable performance.

However, these Transformer models directly work on graph nodes and may have difficulties learning high-level information. Inspired by the vision transformer, which applies to image patches, we propose a new Transformer-based graph neural network: Patch Graph Transformer (PatchGT). Unlike previous transformer-based models for learning graph representations, PatchGT learns from non-trainable graph patches, not from nodes directly. It can help save computation and improve the model performance. The key idea is to segment a graph into patches based on spectral clustering without any trainable parameters, with which the model can first use GNN layers to learn patch-level representations and then use Transformer to obtain graph-level representations. The architecture leverages the spectral information of graphs and combines the strengths of GNNs and Transformers. Further, we show the limitations of previous hierarchical trainable clusters theoretically and empirically. We also prove the proposed non-trainable spectral clustering method is permutation invariant and can help address the information bottlenecks in the graph.

However, although they are state-of-the-art in many machine learning challenges, they still suffer from several limitations. For example, DNNs require a lot of training data, which might not be available in some practical applications. In addition, when small perturbations are added to the inputs, DNNs are prone to misclassification errors. DNNs are also viewed as black-boxes and as such their decisions are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. In this chapter, we review recent works that aim at using graphs as tools to improve deep learning methods. These graphs are defined considering a specific layer in a deep learning architecture. Their vertices represent distinct samples, and their edges depend on the similarity of the corresponding intermediate representations. These graphs can then be leveraged using various methodologies, many of which built on top of graph signal processing. This chapter is composed of four main parts: tools for visualizing intermediate layers in a DNN, denoising data representations, optimizing graph objective functions and regularizing the learning process.",Graphs as Tools to Improve Deep Learning Methods,2021-10-08,"['Myriam Bontonou', 'Bastien Pasdeloup', 'Mounia Hamidouche', 'Vincent Gripon', 'Carlos Lassance', 'Lucas Drumetz']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10044v2,"Recently, there is a revival of interest in low-rank matrix completion-based unsupervised learning through the lens of dual-graph regularization, which has significantly improved the performance of multidisciplinary machine learning tasks such as recommendation systems, genotype imputation and image inpainting. While the dual-graph regularization contributes a major part of the success, computational costly hyper-parameter tunning is usually involved. To circumvent such a drawback and improve the completion performance, we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that automatically learns the hyper-parameters associated with dual-graph regularization, and at the same time, guarantees the low-rankness of matrix completion. Notably, a novel prior is devised to promote the low-rankness of the matrix and encode the dual-graph information simultaneously, which is more challenging than the single-graph counterpart. A nontrivial conditional conjugacy between the proposed priors and likelihood function is then explored such that an efficient algorithm is derived under variational inference framework.

Shapley Flow is the unique solution to a generalization of the Shapley value axioms to directed acyclic graphs. We demonstrate the benefit of using Shapley Flow to reason about the impact of a model's input on its output. In addition to maintaining insights from existing approaches, Shapley Flow extends the flat, set-based, view prevalent in game theory based explanation methods to a deeper, \textit{graph-based}, view.

Having such a representation is the first prerequisite for a variety of machine learning algorithms like classification, clustering, etc., over graph datasets. In this paper, we propose a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix with the $(i,j)$-{th} entry equal to the covariance between normalized vectors $A^ie$ and $A^je$ ($e$ being vector of all ones) as a representation for graph with adjacency matrix $A$. We show that the proposed matrix representation encodes the spectrum of the underlying adjacency matrix and it also contains information about the counts of small sub-structures present in the graph such as triangles and small paths. In addition, we show that this matrix is a \emph{graph invariant}. All these properties make the proposed matrix a suitable object for representing graphs. The representation, being a covariance matrix in a fixed dimensional metric space, gives a mathematical embedding for graphs. This naturally leads to a measure of similarity on graph objects. We define similarity between two given graphs as a Bhattacharya similarity measure between their corresponding covariance matrix representations. As shown in our experimental study on the task of social network classification, such a similarity measure outperforms other widely used state-of-the-art methodologies. Our proposed method is also computationally efficient. The computation of both the matrix representation and the similarity value can be performed in operations linear in the number of edges. This makes our method scalable in practice.

Yet, obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple sum or average over all node representations considers all node features equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods, on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.",Accurate Learning of Graph Representations with Graph Multiset Pooling,2021-02-23,"['Sung Ju Hwang', 'Minki Kang', 'Jinheon Baek']"

Meanwhile, in many classification problems, the label function may vary abruptly in certain graph regions, resulting in high-frequency components. Although the semi-supervised estimation of class labels is an ill-posed problem in general, in several applications it is possible to find a source graph on which the label function has similar frequency content to that on the target graph where the actual classification problem is defined. In this paper, we propose a method for domain adaptation on graphs motivated by these observations. Our algorithm is based on learning the spectrum of the label function in a source graph with many labeled nodes, and transferring the information of the spectrum to the target graph with fewer labeled nodes. While the frequency content of the class label function can be identified through the graph Fourier transform, it is not easy to transfer the Fourier coefficients directly between the two graphs, since no one-to-one match exists between the Fourier basis vectors of independently constructed graphs in the domain adaptation setting. We solve this problem by learning a transformation between the Fourier bases of the two graphs that flexibly ``aligns'' them. The unknown class label function on the target graph is then reconstructed such that its spectrum matches that on the source graph while also ensuring the consistency with the available labels.

Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not incorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their performance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect the evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods for dynamic GNNs are not scalable.

During this process, GNNs are usually guided by pre-defined kernels such as Laplacian matrix, adjacency matrix, or their variants. However, the adoptions of pre-defined kernels may restrain the generalities to different graphs: mismatch between graph and kernel would entail sub-optimal performance. For example, GNNs that focus on low-frequency information may not achieve satisfactory performance when high-frequency information is significant for the graphs, and vice versa.

In contrast to the graph structure data, the i.i.d. node embedding can be processed efficiently in terms of both time and space. Current semi-supervised graph embedding algorithms assume the labelled nodes are given, which may not be always true in the real world. While manually label all training data is inapplicable, how to select the subset of training data to label so as to maximize the graph analysis task performance is of great importance. This motivates our proposed active graph embedding (AGE) framework, in which we design a general active learning query strategy for any semi-supervised graph embedding algorithm. AGE selects the most informative nodes as the training labelled nodes based on the graphical information (i.e., node centrality) as well as the learnt node embedding (i.e., node classification uncertainty and node embedding representativeness). Different query criteria are combined with the time-sensitive parameters which shift the focus from graph based query criteria to embedding based criteria as the learning progresses. Experiments have been conducted on three public data sets and the results verified the effectiveness of each component of our query strategy and the power of combining them using time-sensitive parameters.

By means of this conceptual framework, we propose an algorithm based on reinforcement learning and graph neural networks to learn graph construction and improvement strategies.

The challenge is to encode the information about the graph structure and the attributes associated with the nodes and edges into a low dimensional space. Most existing unsupervised methods promote similar representations across nodes that are topologically close. Recently, it was shown that leveraging additional graph-level information, e.g., information that is shared among all nodes, encourages the representations to be mindful of the global properties of the graph, which greatly improves their quality. However, in most graphs, there is significantly more structure that can be captured, e.g., nodes tend to belong to (multiple) clusters that represent structurally similar nodes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graph representation learning method called Graph InfoClust (GIC), that seeks to additionally capture cluster-level information content. These clusters are computed by a differentiable K-means method and are jointly optimized by maximizing the mutual information between nodes of the same clusters. This optimization leads the node representations to capture richer information and nodal interactions, which improves their quality. Experiments show that GIC outperforms state-of-art methods in various downstream tasks (node classification, link prediction, and node clustering) with a 0.9% to 6.1% gain over the best competing approach, on average.",Graph InfoClust: Leveraging cluster-level node information for unsupervised graph representation learning,2020-09-15,"['Costas Mavromatis', 'George Karypis']"

Current graph embedding approaches either sample a large number of node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization or factorize a high-order proximity/adjacency matrix of the graph via computationally expensive matrix factorization techniques. These approaches typically require significant resources for the learning process and rely on multiple parameters, which limits their applicability in practice. Moreover, most of the existing graph embedding techniques operate effectively in one specific metric space only (e.g., the one produced with cosine similarity), do not preserve higher-order structural features of the input graph and cannot automatically determine a meaningful number of embedding dimensions. Typically, the produced embeddings are not easily interpretable, which complicates further analyses and limits their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DAOR, a highly efficient and parameter-free graph embedding technique producing metric space-robust, compact and interpretable embeddings without any manual tuning. Compared to a dozen state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms, DAOR yields competitive results on both node classification (which benefits form high-order proximity) and link prediction (which relies on low-order proximity mostly).

However, the current GCN-based methods treat graph construction and image classification as two separate tasks, which often results in suboptimal performance. Another defect of these methods is that they mainly focus on modeling the local pairwise importance between graph nodes while lack the capability to capture the global contextual information of HSI. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level GCN with Automatic Graph Learning method (MGCN-AGL) for HSI classification, which can automatically learn the graph information at both local and global levels. By employing attention mechanism to characterize the importance among spatially neighboring regions, the most relevant information can be adaptively incorporated to make decisions, which helps encode the spatial context to form the graph information at local level. Moreover, we utilize multiple pathways for local-level graph convolution, in order to leverage the merits from the diverse spatial context of HSI and to enhance the expressive power of the generated representations. To reconstruct the global contextual relations, our MGCN-AGL encodes the long range dependencies among image regions based on the expressive representations that have been produced at local level. Then inference can be performed along the reconstructed graph edges connecting faraway regions. Finally, the multi-level information is adaptively fused to generate the network output. In this means, the graph learning and image classification can be integrated into a unified framework and benefit each other.

First, they often suffer from high computational complexity, which restricts their applications in large-scale scenarios. Second, they usually perform graph learning either at the single-view level or at the view-consensus level, but often neglect the possibility of the joint learning of single-view and consensus graphs. Third, many of them rely on the k-means for discretization of the spectral embeddings, which lack the ability to directly learn the graph with discrete cluster structure. In light of this, this paper presents an efficient multi-view clustering approach via unified and discrete bipartite graph learning (UDBGL). Specifically, the anchor-based subspace learning is incorporated to learn the view-specific bipartite graphs from multiple views, upon which the bipartite graph fusion is leveraged to learn a view-consensus bipartite graph with adaptive weight learning. Further, the Laplacian rank constraint is imposed to ensure that the fused bipartite graph has discrete cluster structures (with a specific number of connected components). By simultaneously formulating the view-specific bipartite graph learning, the view-consensus bipartite graph learning, and the discrete cluster structure learning into a unified objective function, an efficient minimization algorithm is then designed to tackle this optimization problem and directly achieve a discrete clustering solution without requiring additional partitioning, which notably has linear time complexity in data size.

In this paper, we propose a Graph of Graphs Neural Network, namely GoGNN, which extracts the features in both structured entity graphs and the entity interaction graph in a hierarchical way. We also propose the dual-attention mechanism that enables the model to preserve the neighbor importance in both levels of graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that GoGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two representative structured entity interaction prediction tasks: chemical-chemical interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction.

We show that label propagation, a linearized graph convolutional network, and their combination can all be derived as conditional expectations under our model, when conditioning on different attributes. In addition, the data model highlights deficiencies in existing graph neural networks (while producing new algorithmic solutions), serves as a rigorous statistical framework for understanding graph learning issues such as over-smoothing, creates a testbed for evaluating inductive learning performance, and provides a way to sample graphs attributes that resemble empirical data. We also find that a new algorithm derived from our data generation model, which we call a Linear Graph Convolution, performs extremely well in practice on empirical data, and provide theoretical justification for why this is the case.","A Unifying Generative Model for Graph Learning Algorithms: Label Propagation, Graph Convolutions, and Combinations",2021-01-19,"['Junteng Jia', 'Austin R.

This limits their adoption to only identifying connections among the input variables.

PGM design choices are carefully made such that the inference \& sampling algorithms are efficient. This brings in certain restrictions and often simplifying assumptions. In this work, we propose Neural Graph Revealers (NGRs), that are an attempt to efficiently merge the sparse graph recovery methods with PGMs into a single flow. The problem setting consists of an input data X with D features and M samples and the task is to recover a sparse graph showing connection between the features and learn a probability distribution over the D at the same time. NGRs view the neural networks as a `glass box' or more specifically as a multitask learning framework. We introduce `Graph-constrained path norm' that NGRs leverage to learn a graphical model that captures complex non-linear functional dependencies between the features in the form of an undirected sparse graph. Furthermore, NGRs can handle multimodal inputs like images, text, categorical data, embeddings etc. which is not straightforward to incorporate in the existing methods.

Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP protein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking performance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise similarity based ranking methods. Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph regularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining multiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier in applying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.",Multiple graph regularized protein domain ranking,2012-08-18,"['Jim Jing-Yan Wang', 'Xin Gao', 'Halima Bensmail']"

Graph embedding techniques can be effective in converting high-dimensional sparse graphs into low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector spaces, preserving maximally the graph structure properties. Another type of emerging graph embedding employs Gaussian distribution-based graph embedding with important uncertainty estimation. The main goal of graph embedding methods is to pack every node's properties into a vector with a smaller dimension, hence, node similarity in the original complex irregular spaces can be easily quantified in the embedded vector spaces using standard metrics. The generated nonlinear and highly informative graph embeddings in the latent space can be conveniently used to address different downstream graph analytics tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction, community detection, visualization, etc.). In this Review, we present some fundamental concepts in graph analytics and graph embedding methods, focusing in particular on random walk-based and neural network-based methods. We also discuss the emerging deep learning-based dynamic graph embedding methods.

The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs.

We address the limitations by proposing the Kernel-based Graph Neural Network (KGNN). A KGNN consists of a GNN-based network as well as a kernel-based network parameterized by a memory network. The GNN-based network performs classification through learning graph representations to implicitly capture the similarity between query graphs and labeled graphs, while the kernel-based network uses graph kernels to explicitly compare each query graph with all the labeled graphs stored in a memory for prediction. The two networks are motivated from complementary perspectives, and thus combing them allows KGNN to use labeled graphs more effectively. We jointly train the two networks by maximizing their agreement on unlabeled graphs via posterior regularization, so that the unlabeled graphs serve as a bridge to let both networks mutually enhance each other.

Current leading autoregressive models fail to capture the permutation invariance nature of graphs for the reliance on generation ordering and have high time complexity. Here, we propose a continuous-time generative diffusion process for permutation invariant graph generation to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we first construct a forward diffusion process defined by a stochastic differential equation (SDE), which smoothly converts graphs within the complex distribution to random graphs that follow a known edge probability. Solving the corresponding reverse-time SDE, graphs can be generated from newly sampled random graphs. To facilitate the reverse-time SDE, we newly design a position-enhanced graph score network, capturing the evolving structure and position information from perturbed graphs for permutation equivariant score estimation.

A neglected component in the development of these algorithms has been how best to arrange the learning agents involved to improve distributed search. Here we draw upon results from the networked optimization literatures suggesting that arranging learning agents in communication networks other than fully connected topologies (the implicit way agents are commonly arranged in) can improve learning. We explore the relative performance of four popular families of graphs and observe that one such family (Erdos-Renyi random graphs) empirically outperforms the de facto fully-connected communication topology across several DRL benchmark tasks. Additionally, we observe that 1000 learning agents arranged in an Erdos-Renyi graph can perform as well as 3000 agents arranged in the standard fully-connected topology, showing the large learning improvement possible when carefully designing the topology over which agents communicate. We complement these empirical results with a theoretical investigation of why our alternate topologies perform better.

However, obtaining labels for graphs is expensive in many applications. This is particularly the case for large graphs. To address this, there has been a body of work to learn node representations in a self-supervised manner without labels. Contrastive learning (CL), has been particularly popular to learn representations in a self-supervised manner. In general, CL methods work by maximizing the similarity between representations of augmented views of the same example, and minimizing the similarity between augmented views of different examples. However, existing graph CL methods cannot learn high-quality representations under heterophily, where connected nodes tend to belong to different classes. This is because under heterophily, augmentations of the same example may not be similar to each other. In this work, we address the above problem by proposing the first graph CL method, HLCL, for learning node representations, under heterophily. HLCL uses a high-pass and a low-pass graph filter to generate different views of the same node. Then, it contrasts the two filtered views to learn the final node representations. Effectively, the high-pass filter captures the dissimilarity between nodes in a neighborhood and the low-pass filter captures the similarity between neighboring nodes.Contrasting the two filtered views allows HLCL to learn rich node representations for graphs, under heterophily and homophily.Empirically, HLCL outperforms state-of-the-art graph CL methods on benchmark heterophily datasets and large-scale real-world datasets by up to 10%.",Contrastive Learning under Heterophily,2023-03-11,"['Baharan Mirzasoleiman', 'Wenhan Yang']"

Model selection, or determining which features or covariates are the best explanatory variables, is critical to the interpretability of a learned model. Much of the current literature assumes that covariates are only mildly correlated. However, in many modern applications covariates are highly correlated and do not exhibit key properties (such as the restricted eigenvalue condition, restricted isometry property, or other related assumptions). This work considers a high-dimensional regression setting in which a graph governs both correlations among the covariates and the similarity among regression coefficients -- meaning there is \emph{alignment} between the covariates and regression coefficients. Using side information about the strength of correlations among features, we form a graph with edge weights corresponding to pairwise covariances. This graph is used to define a graph total variation regularizer that promotes similar weights for correlated features.

Inherently, most GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation due to the limitations of the message-passing paradigm.

Inspired by the recently active and emerging self-supervised learning, in this study, we attempt to enhance the representation power of hyperbolic graph models by drawing upon the advantages of contrastive learning. More specifically, we put forward a novel Hyperbolic Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL) framework which learns node representations through multiple hyperbolic spaces to implicitly capture the hierarchical structure shared between different views. Then, we design a hyperbolic position consistency (HPC) constraint based on hyperbolic distance and the homophily assumption to make contrastive learning fit into hyperbolic space. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HGCL as it consistently outperforms competing methods by considerable margins for the node classification task.",Enhancing Hyperbolic Graph Embeddings via Contrastive Learning,2022-01-21,"['Jiahong Liu', 'Min Zhou', 'Shanshan Feng', 'Philippe Fournier-Viger', 'Menglin Yang']"

In this work, we propose a novel graph network layer, known as Node2Seq, to learn node embeddings with explicitly trainable weights for different neighboring nodes. For a target node, our method sorts its neighboring nodes via attention mechanism and then employs 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enable explicit weights for information aggregation.

The fidelity term uses the contrastive loss to properly aggregate the observed layers into a representative embedding. The regularization pushes for a sparse and community-aware graph, and it is based on a measure of graph sparsification called effective resistance, coupled with a penalization of the first few eigenvalues of the representative graph Laplacian matrix to favor the formation of communities.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06962v1,"Graphs are commonly used to characterise interactions between objects of interest. Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning. This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45]. In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

We study a version of this problem that arises in the field of \emph{landscape genetics}, where genetic similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for \emph{inverse landscape genetics}, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development. Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph \emph{effective resistances} (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. 2018 on learning edges in social networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence, significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field.

Classical models either rely on domain-specific predefined generation principles (e.g., in crystal net design), or follow geometry-based prescribed rules. Recently, deep generative models has shown great promise in automatically generating general graphs. However, their advancement into periodic graphs have not been well explored due to several key challenges in 1) maintaining graph periodicity; 2) disentangling local and global patterns; and 3) efficiency in learning repetitive patterns.

Due to the high cost of collecting labeled graph-structured data, domain adaptation is important to supervised graph learning tasks with limited samples. However, current graph domain adaptation methods are generally adopted from traditional domain adaptation tasks, and the properties of graph-structured data are not well utilized. For example, the observed social networks on different platforms are controlled not only by the different crowd or communities but also by the domain-specific policies and the background noise. Based on these properties in graph-structured data, we first assume that the graph-structured data generation process is controlled by three independent types of latent variables, i.e., the semantic latent variables, the domain latent variables, and the random latent variables. Based on this assumption, we propose a disentanglement-based unsupervised domain adaptation method for the graph-structured data, which applies variational graph auto-encoders to recover these latent variables and disentangles them via three supervised learning modules.

To achieve this goal, we develop a new graph contrastive learning framework GOOD-D for detecting OOD graphs without using any ground-truth labels. By performing hierarchical contrastive learning on the augmented graphs generated by our perturbation-free graph data augmentation method, GOOD-D is able to capture the latent ID patterns and accurately detect OOD graphs based on the semantic inconsistency in different granularities (i.e., node-level, graph-level, and group-level).

A promising solution to data scarcity is to pre-train a transferable and expressive GNN model on large amounts of unlabeled graphs or coarse-grained labeled graphs. Then the pre-trained GNN is fine-tuned on downstream datasets with task-specific fine-grained labels. In this paper, we present a novel Graph Matching based GNN Pre-Training framework, called GMPT. Focusing on a pair of graphs, we propose to learn structural correspondences between them via neural graph matching, consisting of both intra-graph message passing and inter-graph message passing. In this way, we can learn adaptive representations for a given graph when paired with different graphs, and both node- and graph-level characteristics are naturally considered in a single pre-training task. The proposed method can be applied to fully self-supervised pre-training and coarse-grained supervised pre-training.

However, in contrast to other domains, the performance of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not satisfying as the number of labeled data for each task is too limited, which calls for additional data to complement the data scarcity. In this paper, we study multi-task learning for molecular property prediction in a novel setting, where a relation graph between tasks is available. We first construct a dataset (ChEMBL-STRING) including around 400 tasks as well as a task relation graph. Then to better utilize such relation graph, we propose a method called SGNN-EBM to systematically investigate the structured task modeling from two perspectives. (1) In the \emph{latent} space, we model the task representations by applying a state graph neural network (SGNN) on the relation graph.

ICD relies on the causal Markov and faithfulness assumptions and recovers the equivalence class of the underlying causal graph. It starts with a complete graph, and consists of a single iterative stage that gradually refines this graph by identifying conditional independence (CI) between connected nodes. Independence and causal relations entailed after any iteration are correct, rendering ICD anytime. Essentially, we tie the size of the CI conditioning set to its distance on the graph from the tested nodes, and increase this value in the successive iteration. Thus, each iteration refines a graph that was recovered by previous iterations having smaller conditioning sets -- a higher statistical power -- which contributes to stability. We demonstrate empirically that ICD requires significantly fewer CI tests and learns more accurate causal graphs compared to FCI, FCI+, and RFCI algorithms (code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/causality-lab).",Iterative Causal Discovery in the Possible Presence of Latent Confounders and Selection Bias,2021-11-07,"['Yaniv Gurwicz', 'Raanan Y.

However, two main limitations persist including compound representation and model interpretability. While atom-level molecular graph representations are commonly used because of their ability to capture natural topology, they may not fully express important substructures or functional groups which significantly influence molecular properties. Consequently, recent research proposes alternative representations employing reduction techniques to integrate higher-level information and leverages both representations for model learning. However, there is still a lack of study about different molecular graph representations on model learning and interpretation. Interpretability is also crucial for drug discovery as it can offer chemical insights and inspiration for optimization. Numerous studies attempt to include model interpretation to explain the rationale behind predictions, but most of them focus solely on individual prediction with little analysis of the interpretation on different molecular graph representations. This research introduces multiple molecular graph representations that incorporate higher-level information and investigates their effects on model learning and interpretation from diverse perspectives. The results indicate that combining atom graph representation with reduced molecular graph representation can yield promising model performance. Furthermore, the interpretation results can provide significant features and potential substructures consistently aligning with background knowledge.

Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with $p$ nodes of degree at most $d$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the $p^{d}$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node. In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of $p^2$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there exists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information.

More often than not, the similarities between samples may be manifested differently by different views. Many existing algorithms either simply take the average of multiple views or just learn a common graph. These simple approaches fail to consider the flexible local manifold structures of all views. Hence, the rich heterogeneous information is not fully exploited. Second, how to learn the explicit cluster structure.

In particular, we show that the algorithmic stability of a GCNN model depends upon the largest absolute eigenvalue of its graph convolution filter. Moreover, to ensure the uniform stability needed to provide strong generalization guarantees, the largest absolute eigenvalue must be independent of the graph size.

However, the process of feature filling and graph learning are separated, resulting in degraded and unstable performance. This problem becomes more serious when a large number of features are missing. We propose an approach that adapts GCN to graphs containing missing features. In contrast to traditional strategy, our approach integrates the processing of missing features and graph learning within the same neural network architecture. Our idea is to represent the missing data by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and calculate the expected activation of neurons in the first hidden layer of GCN, while keeping the other layers of the network unchanged. This enables us to learn the GMM parameters and network weight parameters in an end-to-end manner. Notably, our approach does not increase the computational complexity of GCN and it is consistent with GCN when the features are complete.

The divergence score, generated by the discriminator in a unified latent space, serves as the informativeness measure to actively select the most informative node to be labelled by an oracle.

Our model is able to generate samples from the probability densities learned at each node. This probabilistic data generation model, i.e. convolutional graph auto-encoder (CGAE), is devised based on the localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, deep learning, and the variational Bayesian inference. We apply our CGAE to a new problem, the spatio-temporal probabilistic solar irradiance prediction. Multiple solar radiation measurement sites in a wide area in northern states of the US are modeled as an undirected graph. Using our proposed model, the distribution of future irradiance given historical radiation observations is estimated for every site/node. Numerical results on the National Solar Radiation Database show state-of-the-art performance for probabilistic radiation prediction on geographically distributed irradiance data in terms of reliability, sharpness, and continuous ranked probability score.",Convolutional Graph Auto-encoder: A Deep Generative Neural Architecture for Probabilistic Spatio-temporal Solar Irradiance Forecasting,2018-09-10,"['Mahdi Khodayar', 'Guangyi Liu', 'Jianhui Wang', 'Saeed Mohammadi', 'Mohammad Khodayar']"

Authors have often raised concerns about their lack in scientific publications to improve the quality of the field. Recently, the graph representation learning field has attracted the attention of a wide research community, which resulted in a large stream of works. As such, several Graph Neural Network models have been developed to effectively tackle graph classification. However, experimental procedures often lack rigorousness and are hardly reproducible. Motivated by this, we provide an overview of common practices that should be avoided to fairly compare with the state of the art. To counter this troubling trend, we ran more than 47000 experiments in a controlled and uniform framework to re-evaluate five popular models across nine common benchmarks. Moreover, by comparing GNNs with structure-agnostic baselines we provide convincing evidence that, on some datasets, structural information has not been exploited yet.

However, current studies suffer from several drawbacks: (1) graph CNNs relies on Chebyshev polynomial approximation which results in oscillatory approximation at jump discontinuities; (2) Increasing the order of Chebyshev polynomial can reduce the oscillations issue, but also incurs unaffordable computational cost; (3) Chebyshev polynomials require degree $\Omega$(poly(1/$\epsilon$)) to approximate a jump signal such as $|x|$, while rational function only needs $\mathcal{O}$(poly log(1/$\epsilon$))\cite{liang2016deep,telgarsky2017neural}. However, it's non-trivial to apply rational approximation without increasing computational complexity due to the denominator. In this paper, the superiority of rational approximation is exploited for graph signal recovering. RatioanlNet is proposed to integrate rational function and neural networks. We show that rational function of eigenvalues can be rewritten as a function of graph Laplacian, which can avoid multiplication by the eigenvector matrix. Focusing on the analysis of approximation on graph convolution operation, a graph signal regression task is formulated. Under graph signal regression task, its time complexity can be significantly reduced by graph Fourier transform. To overcome the local minimum problem of neural networks model, a relaxed Remez algorithm is utilized to initialize the weight parameters. Convergence rate of RatioanlNet and polynomial based methods on jump signal is analyzed for a theoretical guarantee.

The optimization formulation minimizes the upper bound of the noisy tensor estimation error for multiple graph alignment, by learning with a subset of the eigen-pairs in the spectrum of the normalized tensor product graph. We also provide a data-dependent transductive Rademacher bound for binary hyperlink prediction. We accelerate LowrankTLP with parallel tensor computation which enables label propagation on a tensor product of 100 graphs each of size 1000 in less than half hour in the simulation. LowrankTLP was also applied to predicting the author-paper-venue hyperlinks in publication records, alignment of segmented regions across up to 26 CT-scan images and alignment of protein-protein interaction networks across multiple species. The experiments demonstrate that LowrankTLP indeed well approximates the original label propagation with better scalability and accuracy.",Scalable Label Propagation for Multi-relational Learning on the Tensor Product of Graphs,2018-02-20,"['Zhuliu Li', 'George Karypis', 'Raphael Petegrosso', 'Rui Kuang', 'David Sterling', 'Shaden Smith']"

However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL. According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based, and hybrid approaches. We further describe the applications of graph SSL across various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL.

Although many works have been proposed for dynamic graph modeling in recent years, effective and scalable models are yet to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network approach, called TCL, which deals with the dynamically-evolving graph in a continuous-time fashion and enables effective dynamic node representation learning that captures both the temporal and topology information. Technically, our model contains three novel aspects. First, we generalize the vanilla Transformer to temporal graph learning scenarios and design a graph-topology-aware transformer. Secondly, on top of the proposed graph transformer, we introduce a two-stream encoder that separately extracts representations from temporal neighborhoods associated with the two interaction nodes and then utilizes a co-attentional transformer to model inter-dependencies at a semantic level. Lastly, we are inspired by the recently developed contrastive learning and propose to optimize our model by maximizing mutual information (MI) between the predictive representations of two future interaction nodes. Benefiting from this, our dynamic representations can preserve high-level (or global) semantics about interactions and thus is robust to noisy interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply contrastive learning to representation learning on dynamic graphs.

Recent work attributes the success of visual CL to use of task-relevant augmentations and large, diverse datasets. Interestingly, graph CL frameworks report strong performance despite using orders of magnitude smaller datasets and employing domain-agnostic graph augmentations (DAGAs). Motivated by this discrepancy, we probe the quality of representations learnt by popular graph CL frameworks using DAGAs. We find that DAGAs can destroy task-relevant information and harm the model's ability to learn discriminative representations. On small benchmark datasets, we show the inductive bias of graph neural networks can significantly compensate for this weak discriminability. Based on our findings, we propose several sanity checks that enable practitioners to quickly assess the quality of their model's learned representations. We further propose a broad strategy for designing task-aware augmentations that are amenable to graph CL and demonstrate its efficacy on two large-scale, complex graph applications.

To this end, we relate GCL with invariant rationale discovery, and propose a new framework, Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL).

Self-supervised representation learning, which can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential approach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised learning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with homogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we propose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure Information based on Metapath (SESIM).

In order to predict jump number, SESIM uses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling. Moreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph structure information, which is the essential property between nodes. Therefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure.

However, all existing methods either fail to utilize the orthogonal property of the representations generated by GAE, or separate the clustering and the learning of neural networks. We first prove that the relaxed k-means will obtain an optimal partition in the inner-products used space. Driven by theoretical analysis about relaxed k-means, we design a specific GAE-based model for graph clustering to be consistent with the theory, namely Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder (EGAE). Meanwhile, the learned representations are well explainable such that the representations can be also used for other tasks. To further induce the neural network to produce deep features that are appropriate for the specific clustering model, the relaxed k-means and GAE are learned simultaneously. Therefore, the relaxed k-means can be equivalently regarded as a decoder that attempts to learn representations that can be linearly constructed by some centroid vectors.

Existing methods construct the contrastive samples by adding perturbations to the graph structure or node attributes. Although impressive results are achieved, it is rather blind to the wealth of prior information assumed: with the increase of the perturbation degree applied on the original graph, 1) the similarity between the original graph and the generated augmented graph gradually decreases; 2) the discrimination between all nodes within each augmented view gradually increases. In this paper, we argue that both such prior information can be incorporated (differently) into the contrastive learning paradigm following our general ranking framework. In particular, we first interpret CL as a special case of learning to rank (L2R), which inspires us to leverage the ranking order among positive augmented views.

For semi-supervised problems, the common approach is to solve a constrained optimization problem, regularized by a Dirichlet energy, based on the graph-Laplacian. However, as supervision decreases, Dirichlet optimization becomes suboptimal. We therefore would like to obtain a smooth transition between unsupervised clustering and low-supervised graph-based classification. In this paper, we propose a new type of graph-Laplacian which is adapted for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) problems.

The standard communication architecture typically involves all agents intermittently communicating with each other (fully connected topology) or with a centralized server (star topology). Unfortunately, optimizing the topology of communication over the space of all possible graphs is a hard problem, so we borrow results from the networked optimization and collective intelligence literatures which suggest that certain families of network topologies can lead to strong improvements over fully-connected networks. We start by introducing alternative network topologies to DRL benchmark tasks under the Evolution Strategies paradigm which we call Network Evolution Strategies. We explore the relative performance of the four main graph families and observe that one such family (Erdos-Renyi random graphs) empirically outperforms all other families, including the de facto fully-connected communication topologies. Additionally, the use of alternative network topologies has a multiplicative performance effect: we observe that when 1000 learning agents are arranged in a carefully designed communication topology, they can compete with 3000 agents arranged in the de facto fully-connected topology.

However, GCNs may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks on label-scarce dynamic graphs. Many existing works aim to strengthen the robustness of GCNs; for instance, adversarial training is used to shield GCNs against malicious perturbations. However, these works fail on dynamic graphs for which label scarcity is a pressing issue. To overcome label scarcity, self-training attempts to iteratively assign pseudo-labels to highly confident unlabeled nodes but such attempts may suffer serious degradation under dynamic graph perturbations. In this paper, we generalize noisy supervision as a kind of self-supervised learning method and then propose a novel Bayesian self-supervision model, namely GraphSS, to address the issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSS can not only affirmatively alert the perturbations on dynamic graphs but also effectively recover the prediction of a node classifier when the graph is under such perturbations.

While existing methods tend to focus on preserving structural properties, the robustness of the learned representations against noises is generally ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn noise-free node representations and eliminate noises simultaneously. Since noises are often unknown on real graphs, we design two generators, namely a graph generator and a noise generator, to identify normal structures and noises in an unsupervised setting. On the one hand, the graph generator serves as a unified scheme to incorporate any useful graph prior knowledge to generate normal structures. We illustrate the generative process with community structures and power-law degree distributions as examples. On the other hand, the noise generator generates graph noises not only satisfying some fundamental properties but also in an adaptive way. Thus, real noises with arbitrary distributions can be handled successfully. Finally, in order to eliminate noises and obtain noise-free node representations, two generators need to be optimized jointly, and through maximum likelihood estimation, we equivalently convert the model into imposing different regularization constraints on the true graph and noises respectively.

However, since real-world scenarios often differ from training datasets, effectively modeling the behavior of various road users in an environment remains a significant research challenge. This reality necessitates models that generalize to a broad range of domains and explicitly model interactions between road users and the environment to improve scenario understanding. Graph learning methods address this problem by modeling interactions using graph representations of scenarios. However, existing methods cannot effectively transfer knowledge gained from the training domain to real-world scenarios.

However, existing LFMs predict missing values in a user-item rating matrix only based on the known ones, and thus the sparsity of the rating matrix always limits their performance. Meanwhile, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective way to alleviate the label (i.e., rating) sparsity problem by performing label propagation, which is mainly based on the smoothness insight on affinity graphs. However, graph-based SSL suffers serious scalability and graph unreliable problems when directly being applied to do recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic chain graph model (CGM) to marry SSL with LFM. The proposed CGM is a combination of Bayesian network and Markov random field. The Bayesian network is used to model the rating generation and regression procedures, and the Markov random field is used to model the confidence-aware smoothness constraint between the generated ratings.

To this end, we design a simple yet effective two-stage scene graph parsing framework utilizing abstract meaning representation, SGRAM (Scene GRaph parsing via Abstract Meaning representation): 1) transforming a textual description of an image into an AMR graph (Text-to-AMR) and 2) encoding the AMR graph into a Transformer-based language model to generate a scene graph (AMR-to-SG). Experimental results show the scene graphs generated by our framework outperforms the dependency parsing-based model by 11.61\% and the previous state-of-the-art model using a pre-trained Transformer language model by 3.78\%. Furthermore, we apply SGRAM to image retrieval task which is one of downstream tasks for scene graph, and confirm the effectiveness of scene graphs generated by our framework.",SGRAM: Improving Scene Graph Parsing via Abstract Meaning Representation,2022-10-17,"['Yu-Jung Heo', 'Byoung-Tak Zhang', 'Woo Suk Choi']"

Visualising complex networks is crucial to understand and make sense of networked data and the relationships it represents. Due to the large size of many networks, visualisation is extremely difficult; the simple method of drawing large networks like those of Facebook or Twitter leads to graphics that convey little or no information. While modern graph layout algorithms can scale computationally to large networks, their output tends to a common hairball look, which makes it difficult to even distinguish different graphs from each other. Graph sampling and graph coarsening techniques partially address these limitations but they are only able to preserve a subset of the properties of the original graphs. In this paper we take the problem of visualising large graphs from a novel perspective: we leave the original graph's nodes and edges behind, and instead summarise its properties such as the clustering coefficient and bipartivity by generating a completely new graph whose structural properties match that of the original graph. To verify the utility of this approach as compared to other graph visualisation algorithms, we perform an experimental evaluation in which we repeatedly asked experimental subjects (professionals in graph mining and related areas) to determine which of two given graphs has a given structural property and then assess which visualisation algorithm helped in identifying the correct answer.

Based upon previous arguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger inequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering. Simple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to small cuts in the graph. Together, these results show that unbalanced partitions from spectral clustering can be understood as overfitting to noise in the periphery of a sparse and stochastic graph.

As such knowledge graphs represent an attractive source of information that could help improve recommender systems. However, existing approaches in this domain rely on manual feature engineering and do not allow for an end-to-end training. Here we propose Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Networks with Label Smoothness regularization (KGNN-LS) to provide better recommendations. Conceptually, our approach computes user-specific item embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important knowledge graph relationships for a given user. This way we transform the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph and then apply a graph neural network to compute personalized item embeddings. To provide better inductive bias, we rely on label smoothness assumption, which posits that adjacent items in the knowledge graph are likely to have similar user relevance labels/scores. Label smoothness provides regularization over the edge weights and we prove that it is equivalent to a label propagation scheme on a graph. We also develop an efficient implementation that shows strong scalability with respect to the knowledge graph size. Experiments on four datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art baselines.

To this end, most existing studies focus on the representation and recognition of states, but ignore the changing transitional relations among them. In this paper, we present evolutionary state graph, a dynamic graph structure designed to systematically represent the evolving relations (edges) among states (nodes) along time. We conduct analysis on the dynamic graphs constructed from the time-series data and show that changes on the graph structures (e.g., edges connecting certain state nodes) can inform the occurrences of events (i.e., time-series fluctuation). Inspired by this, we propose a novel graph neural network model, Evolutionary State Graph Network (EvoNet), to encode the evolutionary state graph for accurate and interpretable time-series event prediction. Specifically, Evolutionary State Graph Network models both the node-level (state-to-state) and graph-level (segment-to-segment) propagation, and captures the node-graph (state-to-segment) interactions over time.

As yet, deep generative models for temporal graphs are not yet well understood and existing techniques for static graphs are not adequate for temporal graphs since they cannot 1) encode and decode continuously-varying graph topology chronologically, 2) enforce validity via temporal constraints, or 3) ensure efficiency for information-lossless temporal resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a new model, called ``Temporal Graph Generative Adversarial Network'' (TG-GAN) for continuous-time temporal graph generation, by modeling the deep generative process for truncated temporal random walks and their compositions. Specifically, we first propose a novel temporal graph generator that jointly model truncated edge sequences, time budgets, and node attributes, with novel activation functions that enforce temporal validity constraints under recurrent architecture. In addition, a new temporal graph discriminator is proposed, which combines time and node encoding operations over a recurrent architecture to distinguish the generated sequences from the real ones sampled by a newly-developed truncated temporal random walk sampler.

Such methods have shown promising results on a broad spectrum of applications ranging from social science, biomedicine, and particle physics to computer vision, graphics, and chemistry. One of the limitations of the majority of current graph neural network architectures is that they are often restricted to the transductive setting and rely on the assumption that the underlying graph is {\em known} and {\em fixed}. Often, this assumption is not true since the graph may be noisy, or partially and even completely unknown. In such cases, it would be helpful to infer the graph directly from the data, especially in inductive settings where some nodes were not present in the graph at training time. Furthermore, learning a graph may become an end in itself, as the inferred structure may provide complementary insights next to the downstream task.

Further, although heterogeneous graphs have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of behaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity.

However, when learning the initial representation for a node, most existing work linearly combines the embeddings of node features, without considering the interactions among the features (or feature embeddings). We argue that when the node features are categorical, e.g., in many real-world applications like user profiling and recommender system, feature interactions usually carry important signals for predictive analytics. Ignoring them will result in suboptimal initial node representation and thus weaken the effectiveness of the follow-up graph convolution. In this paper, we propose a new GCN model named CatGCN, which is tailored for graph learning when the node features are categorical. Specifically, we integrate two ways of explicit interaction modeling into the learning of initial node representation, i.e., local interaction modeling on each pair of node features and global interaction modeling on an artificial feature graph. We then refine the enhanced initial node representations with the neighborhood aggregation-based graph convolution. We train CatGCN in an end-to-end fashion and demonstrate it on semi-supervised node classification.

Among the many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness measures the model fairness from a causal perspective by comparing the predictions of each individual from the original data and the counterfactuals. In counterfactuals, the sensitive attribute values of this individual had been modified. Recently, a few works extend counterfactual fairness to graph data, but most of them neglect the following facts that can lead to biases: 1) the sensitive attributes of each node's neighbors may causally affect the prediction w.r.t. this node; 2) the sensitive attributes may causally affect other features and the graph structure. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel fairness notion - graph counterfactual fairness, which considers the biases led by the above facts.

In this framework, we generate counterfactuals corresponding to perturbations on each node's and their neighbors' sensitive attributes. Then we enforce fairness by minimizing the discrepancy between the representations learned from the original graph and the counterfactuals for each node.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02667v2,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to possess strong representation power, which can be exploited for downstream prediction tasks on graph-structured data, such as molecules and social networks. They typically learn representations by aggregating information from the $K$-hop neighborhood of individual vertices or from the enumerated walks in the graph. Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating weighting schemes into GNNs; however, this has been primarily limited to $K$-hop neighborhood GNNs so far. In this paper, we aim to design an algorithm incorporating weighting schemes into walk-aggregating GNNs and analyze their effect. We propose a novel GNN model, called AWARE, that aggregates information about the walks in the graph using attention schemes. This leads to an end-to-end supervised learning method for graph-level prediction tasks in the standard setting where the input is the adjacency and vertex information of a graph, and the output is a predicted label for the graph. We then perform theoretical, empirical, and interpretability analyses of AWARE. Our theoretical analysis in a simplified setting identifies successful conditions for provable guarantees, demonstrating how the graph information is encoded in the representation, and how the weighting schemes in AWARE affect the representation and learning performance. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of AWARE in graph-level prediction tasks in the standard setting in the domains of molecular property prediction and social networks. Lastly, our interpretation study illustrates that AWARE can successfully capture the important substructures of the input graph.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06743v1,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning graph representations and thus facilitating various graph-related tasks. However, most GNN methods adopt a supervised learning setting, which is not always feasible in real-world applications due to the difficulty to obtain labeled data. Hence, graph self-supervised learning has been attracting increasing attention. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a representative framework for self-supervised learning. In general, GCL learns node representations by contrasting semantically similar nodes (positive samples) and dissimilar nodes (negative samples) with anchor nodes. Without access to labels, positive samples are typically generated by data augmentation, and negative samples are uniformly sampled from the entire graph, which leads to a sub-optimal objective. Specifically, data augmentation naturally limits the number of positive samples that involve in the process (typically only one positive sample is adopted). On the other hand, the random sampling process would inevitably select false-negative samples (samples sharing the same semantics with the anchor). These issues limit the learning capability of GCL. In this work, we propose an enhanced objective that addresses the aforementioned issues. We first introduce an unachievable ideal objective that contains all positive samples and no false-negative samples. This ideal objective is then transformed into a probabilistic form based on the distributions for sampling positive and negative samples. We then model these distributions with node similarity and derive the enhanced objective. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced objective under different settings.",Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Node Similarity,2022-08-13,"['Hongliang Chi', 'Yao Ma']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08792v1,"Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as an effective learning paradigm to alleviate the reliance on labelling information for graph representation learning. The core of GCL is to maximise the mutual information between the representation of a node and its contextual representation (i.e., the corresponding instance with similar semantic information) summarised from the contextual scope (e.g., the whole graph or 1-hop neighbourhood). This scheme distils valuable self-supervision signals for GCL training. However, existing GCL methods still suffer from limitations, such as the incapacity or inconvenience in choosing a suitable contextual scope for different datasets and building biased contrastiveness. To address aforementioned problems, we present a simple self-supervised learning method termed Unifying Graph Contrastive Learning with Flexible Contextual Scopes (UGCL for short). Our algorithm builds flexible contextual representations with tunable contextual scopes by controlling the power of an adjacency matrix. Additionally, our method ensures contrastiveness is built within connected components to reduce the bias of contextual representations. Based on representations from both local and contextual scopes, UGCL optimises a very simple contrastive loss function for graph representation learning. Essentially, the architecture of UGCL can be considered as a general framework to unify existing GCL methods. We have conducted intensive experiments and achieved new state-of-the-art performance in six out of eight benchmark datasets compared with self-supervised graph representation learning baselines.

Existing representation learning methods on graphs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various graph-related tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, we observe that these methods could leak serious private information. For instance, one can accurately infer the links (or node identity) in a graph from a node classifier (or link predictor) trained on the learnt node representations by existing methods. To address the issue, we propose a privacy-preserving representation learning framework on graphs from the \emph{mutual information} perspective. Specifically, our framework includes a primary learning task and a privacy protection task, and we consider node classification and link prediction as the two tasks of interest. Our goal is to learn node representations such that they can be used to achieve high performance for the primary learning task, while obtaining performance for the privacy protection task close to random guessing. We formally formulate our goal via mutual information objectives. However, it is intractable to compute mutual information in practice. Then, we derive tractable variational bounds for the mutual information terms, where each bound can be parameterized via a neural network. Next, we train these parameterized neural networks to approximate the true mutual information and learn privacy-preserving node representations. We finally evaluate our framework on various graph datasets.",Privacy-Preserving Representation Learning on Graphs: A Mutual Information Perspective,2021-07-03,"['Yiran Chen', 'Jiayi Guo', 'Hai Li', 'Ang Li', 'Binghui Wang']"
